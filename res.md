The best resources to learn how to build an operating system for a graduate capstone project combine comprehensive textbooks, practical guides, open-source projects, and educational communities:

- **Textbooks (Theory & Design)**
  - *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* (OSTEP) by Arpaci-Dusseau. Highly regarded for clear explanations of virtualization, concurrency, and persistence, with practical mini-projects[1][4][5].
  - *Modern Operating Systems* and *Operating Systems Design and Implementation* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum are classics for both design theory and practical insights[2][5].
  - *Operating System Concepts* (the “Dinosaur Book”) is another foundational text, widely used in university courses[2][5].

- **Hands-On and Project-Based Resources**
  - The **xv6 book**: Teaches OS concepts through building and exploring xv6, a small Unix-like OS. Includes code walkthroughs and exercises[1][5].
  - The **PintOS Project**: A challenging educational OS project often used in upper-level courses. Excellent for building a deeper understanding of threads, file systems, and virtual memory in C[2][3].
  - **MikeOS**: A minimal OS you can study and modify, ideal for a quick, practical introduction[3].
  - *Operating Systems: From 0 to 1* (open PDF): A hands-on guide that walks through low-level OS building steps in detail[5].

- **Online Courses & Lectures**
  - **UC Berkeley CS 162**, **MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) “Operating Systems Engineering”**, and **Stanford’s OS courses**: Offer lecture videos, assignments, and sometimes projects such as Nachos or PintOS[2][3].
  - **Coursera** and **edX**: Host introductory and intermediate OS courses, including practical labs[2][9].

- **Communities and Wikis**
  - **OSDev Wiki**: The central hub for practical OS development, tutorials, code snippets, and advice for all skill levels. Start here for setup, project ideas, and troubleshooting[1][2][6][7].
  - **Reddit r/osdev** and Stack Overflow (osdev tag): Ask questions, share progress, and get feedback from experienced hobbyists and professionals[2][5].

- **Advanced Resources and Code Reading**
  - *Linux Kernel Development* by Robert Love and the **Linux Insides book**: For learning from production codebases once you’ve mastered OS basics[3][7].

- **Open Source Projects for Reference or Contribution**
  - Projects like **Linux**, **MINIX**, **Nachos**, and smaller educational OSes such as **OS/161** or **nanoos**. Reading and contributing to these will expose you to real-world OS engineering[3][5].

- **Virtual Labs & Experimentation Tools**
  - Use QEMU or Bochs emulators for safely testing your OS. Tools like OSLab and OSv provide controlled environments to explore OS mechanisms[2].

Key advice:
- Start with OSTEP or xv6 for fundamental concepts and practical exercises.
- Use OSDev Wiki as your day-to-day guide and for community support.
- Take on a project like PintOS or a “from-scratch” tutorial (such as *Operating Systems: From 0 to 1*) depending on your academic requirements and time frame.
- Engage with communities early for troubleshooting and feedback.
- Once comfortable, examine and contribute to real open-source OS code for advanced learning.

You may mix and match resources based on your experience level and the project requirements. If you need specific advice on structuring your capstone project or integrating existing codebases, let me know.
